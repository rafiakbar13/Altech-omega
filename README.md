# Technologies used
- This project is implemented using TypeScript. Because TypeScript can improve the resilience and quality of code, it is being used in the implementation of this project. Strong type checking is enforced by TypeScript, which facilitates the early detection and prevention of possible defects or errors during the development process.

- For this project, I've decided to use React with Vite. One notable feature of Vite is its lightning-fast development server, which shortens the development cycle and enables real-time feedback while developing. Furthermore, Vite is excellent at streamlining the build process by only including dependencies that are actively used by the application

- Tailwind CSS is what I've chosen to use for this project's styling. With its utility-first methodology, Tailwind CSS facilitates rapid development. I can quickly create components with little code while keeping a visually pleasing design.

- For further styling, I'm utilizing Tailwind CSS in conjunction with Heroicons and Headless UI. They work well with Tailwind, offering a large library of icons and adaptable parts that guarantee a streamlined and effective design.

- I've integrated React Router DOM to control the routing of the application. I can define routes using JSX syntax thanks to React Router DOM, which makes routing declarative. This method improves the overall visualization of the navigation flow of the application while significantly streamlining the setup of new routes.
